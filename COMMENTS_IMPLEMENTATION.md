### API Service

1. **CommentApiService** (`src/services/commentApi.ts`)

## Usage

### Basic Implementation

```tsx
import CommentableText from '@/components/comments/CommentableText';

function MyComponent() {
  const { user } = useAppSelector((state) => state.auth);
  
  return (
    <CommentableText
      content="Your text content here"
      itemId="item-id"
      currentUserId={user?._id || ""}
      className="your-styles"
    />
  );
}
```

### Integration with Item Preview

The comment system is already integrated into the `ItemPreviewModal` component for text items. When users view text items, they can:

1. Select text to add inline comments
2. Click the comments button to view all comments
3. Reply to existing comments
4. Add reactions and resolve comments

## Backend API

### Endpoints

- `POST /api/v1/comments` - Create a new comment
- `GET /api/v1/comments?itemId=...` - Get comments for an item
- `GET /api/v1/comments/:commentId` - Get a specific comment
- `PATCH /api/v1/comments/:commentId` - Update a comment
- `DELETE /api/v1/comments/:commentId` - Delete a comment
- `POST /api/v1/comments/:commentId/reply` - Reply to a comment
- `POST /api/v1/comments/:commentId/reaction` - Add a reaction
- `DELETE /api/v1/comments/:commentId/reaction` - Remove a reaction
- `PATCH /api/v1/comments/:commentId/resolve` - Mark comment as resolved

### Comment Schema

```typescript
interface Comment {
  _id: string;
  itemId: string;
  userId: {
    _id: string;
    name: string;
    email: string;
  };
  content: string;
  parentId?: {
    _id: string;
    content: string;
  };
  replies: Array<{
    _id: string;
    content: string;
  }>;
  isResolved: boolean;
  isEdited: boolean;
  isDeleted: boolean;
  reactions: CommentReaction[];
  position?: {
    start: number;
    end: number;
    selectedText?: string;
  };
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

## User Experience

## Technical Details

### State Management
- Uses React hooks for local state management
- Redux for user authentication state
- No global state needed for comments (fetched on demand)

### Performance
- Comments are loaded only when needed
- Pagination prevents loading too many comments at once
- Efficient re-rendering with React.memo where appropriate

### Accessibility
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader friendly
- Proper ARIA labels and roles
- Focus management for modals and panels

### Error Handling
- Graceful error handling for API failures
- User-friendly error messages
- Fallback states for loading and error conditions

## Future Enhancements

1. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live comment updates
2. **Rich Text Comments**: Support for markdown and formatting
3. **Comment Notifications**: Email and in-app notifications for new comments
4. **Comment Analytics**: Track comment engagement and usage
5. **Advanced Filtering**: Filter by user, date range, and content type
6. **Comment Export**: Export comments for reporting and analysis

## Dependencies

### Frontend
- `@radix-ui/react-select` - Select components for filtering

## Installation

The comment system is already integrated into the application. No additional installation steps are required beyond the existing dependencies.

## Testing

To test the comment system:

1. Create or view a text item
2. Select some text to trigger the comment bubble
3. Add a comment and verify it appears in the comments panel
4. Test replies, reactions, and comment management features
5. Verify the system works across different item types
